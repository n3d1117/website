This post describes how to continue using the [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) iOS app after [it was suspended]((https://mashable.com/article/twitter-elon-musk-third-party-client-api-tweetbot-twitterrific/)), by swapping their Twitter API key with your own using a man-in-the-middle proxy to reroute authentication requests.

## Introduction

I've been a [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) user for as long as I can remember, and it's been my favorite iOS app ever, by far. As such, I was **devastated** to learn that Twitter, on January 12th 2023, [suspended _all_ third party clients overnight](https://mashable.com/article/twitter-elon-musk-third-party-client-api-tweetbot-twitterrific/) by revoking access to their API keys.

From the [Tweetbot memorial](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/):
> On January 12th, 2023, without warning, Elon Musk ordered his employees at Twitter to suspend access to 3rd party clients which instantly locked out hundreds of thousands of users from accessing Twitter from their favorite clients. Weâ€™ve invested over 10 years building Tweetbot for Twitter and it was shut down in a blink of an eye. We are very sorry to all of our customers who chose Tweetbot as their way to interact with Twitterâ€™s service and we thank you so much for the many years of support and feedback.

After a decade of using Tweetbot, I could not stand using the official Twitter iOS app, for several reasons:
- Riddled with ads and trackers
- No UI customization options (such as inline media)
- Not showing my feed in chronological order by default

## A glimpse of hope
Even though I mostly moved to [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), not everyone has moved yet, so I began looking for solutions. That's when I stumbled upon [this post](https://notnow.dev/notice/ARh4u5BJD8mf2jG5yK) by developer [Zhuowei Zhang](https://zhuoweizhang.net), suggesting a way to use a custom API key to login and linking to his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/zhuowei/TweetbotLoginProxy) for a proof of concept.

As it turns out, it totally works!

## Reviving Tweetbot
Here's how I got Tweetbot up and running again on my iOS device.

### 1. Create a new Twitter application
* Head over to Twitter's [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com) and add a new Application
    * Note: You might need to create a Project first
    * Make sure to copy your app's API Key and Secret somewhere
    * When asked for **Type of app**, select "Native App"
    * Use `tweetbot:///request_token` as callback URI
    * Once done, you need to enable "Elevated access" for your project

### 2. Set up local proxy server and redirect
* Install [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) (if you're using a Mac, run `brew install mitmproxy`)
* Clone the [zhuowei/TweetbotLoginProxy](https://github.com/zhuowei/TweetbotLoginProxy) GitHub repository
* Edit `run.sh.template` by adding your app's API key and secret, and rename the file to `run.sh`
* Set up a local proxy to redirect Tweetbot's authentication servers to your own local instance:

    ```bash
    mitmweb --map-remote "@https://push.tapbots.com/@http://localhost:3000/"
    ```
* Run the local server with:

    ```bash
    npm install && ./run.sh
    ```

### 3. Connect to the proxy
* Make sure your iOS device is connected to the same network as your computer, and take note of your computer's local IP address (on macOS you can see it by alt-clicking the WiFi icon on your menu bar)
* On your iOS device, go to Settings -> Wi-Fi and click the (i) button next to the name of your WiFi network
* Scroll down and click on `Configure Proxy`, tick `Manual` and insert your computer's IP address in the `Server` field and `8080` in the `Port` field. Click `Save` to save your changes.

* Next, we need to install mitmproxy's **Certificate Authority** to intercept HTTPS requests. From your iOS device, head over to [mitm.it](https://mitm.it) and click on `get mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem` button under the iOS section
* You will be asked if you want to download configuration profile - press Allow button. Now go back to Settings app. You will see `Profile Downloaded` cell on the top. Pressing it will open the `Install Profile` dialog with Install button at the top - press it and verify the installation with your passcode[^1]
* Go back to the home screen of Settings app and go `General` -> `About` -> `Certificate Trust Settings`. Make sure the switch next to `mitmproxy` text is on. At this point, your `mitmproxy` instance should be showing HTTP requests that iOS and various apps are making in the background[^1].

### 4. Test it out
Finally, open Tweetbot app on your iOS device and try to log in.
With some luck, you should be redirected the Twitter's authorization page, showing the App you created earlier:

{{< note variant="success" >}}
That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Once logged in, you should be able to use Tweetbot normally. You can stop the `mitmproxy` instance and disable proxy configuration on your iOS device.

You should also be able to see `mitmproxy` correctly rerouting your HTTP requests through the local proxy running on port `3000`:
