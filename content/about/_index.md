{{< subhead title="👋 About me" >}}
Hey there! I'm **Edoardo**, a computer science engineer passionate about iOS development.

Previously, I’ve built some [tweaks](https://github.com/n3d1117/n3d1117.github.io) for jailbroken iOS devices --- such as [Runaway](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/02/23/runaway/), a tweak to show network speed in the status bar.

In this section you'll find some info about me, and a few things I like to keep track of: [movies](/about/movies) and [TV shows](/about/shows) I've watched, [books](/about/books) I've read, [artists](/about/music) I've listened to and [games](/about/games) I've played. These lists are updated automatically every day!
