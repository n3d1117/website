This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/n3d1117/website). In this page you can find some info about my work experience, education, and a few things I like to keep track of:
- [Movies](/about/movies) and [TV shows](/about/shows) I've watched
- [Books](/about/books) I've read
- [Artists](/about/music) I've listened to
- [Games](/about/games) I've played

These lists are updated automatically every day!
