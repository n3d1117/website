# [👋](about/) About me
Hey there! I'm **Edoardo**, a computer science engineer passionate about iOS development.

In 2022, I graduated from the University of Florence in Italy with a master's degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

I'm currently working as iOS developer at [Shape Games](https://www.shapegames.com). Previously, I helped building the iOS app for [greenApes](https://www.greenapes.com/en/), a social network focused on sustainability and positive environment impact.

I also enjoy reverse engineering, automation and open source software. Sometimes I share findings in my [blog](/blog).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/n3d1117/) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@nedo/). If you want to get in touch, feel free to [write me an email](mailto:contact@edoardo.fyi)!
