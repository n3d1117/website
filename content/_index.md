# 👋 About me
Hey there! I'm **Edoardo**, a computer science engineer passionate about iOS development. 

I hold a MSc in Computer Science and Engineering, and I currently work at [Magenta](https://magentalab.it) --- mainly building the iOS app for [greenApes](https://www.greenapes.com/en/), a social network focused on sustainability and positive environment impact. See the [about page](/about) for more info.

I also enjoy reverse engineering, automation and open source software. Sometimes I share my thoughts and findings in [blog posts](/blog). Previously, I’ve built some [tweaks](https://github.com/n3d1117/n3d1117.github.io) for jailbroken iOS devices --- such as [Runaway](https://github.com/n3d1117/n3d1117.github.io), a tweak to show network speed in the status bar.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/n3d1117/) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@nedo/). If you want to get in touch, write an email to [contact@edoardo.fyi](mailto:contact@edoardo.fyi)
